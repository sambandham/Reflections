1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	To share my files at faster rate without sending via huge file sizes and zip files.
2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is used to select the particular files that are need to be tracked.
3)How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	We can consider this as an virtual temporary file where we can store files temporarily.
4)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches helps to preserve the old versions of our file rather than making changes to the entire files.
5)How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They give a detailed visualization on in which branch the commits are made.
6)What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	So that we can concatenate both the files and representing them makes which branches are merged.
7)What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
