1)How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It can be used to denote at which line We/I have made changes in the file.
2)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	Well by knowing the historical versions of the file as a programmer in case if i am adding some modifications to the file and 
	that doesnt goes cool then i can easily jump back to the older versions with ease.
3)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	By this we can tell the viewers about where there is a major change so that they get used to it.
4)Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	It has both advantage and disadvantage because sometimes we need only one file to show the changes.
5)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	git log is used to find the changes that are made....and the git diff is used to compare the changes..
6)How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	We can feel very confident and we can rid of getting fear from the mistakes...
7)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	I will my use my git for publishing my projects globally so i can get valuable comments which may be a good solution for my upgrades.
