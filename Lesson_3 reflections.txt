1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	To make our files available any time online so that we can access them at any where and at any point of time.
2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So that we can say github that at which point of time i want all my files in my local directory.
